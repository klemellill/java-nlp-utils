Differences from Klein NLP framework
- util/
  - Counter(Map)
    - Moved to double[]([])*
    - Encoded by default (access methods for templated values, raw integers)
    - Expose raw double[]([])* for fast access
    - Encoding for same types should share int values (counter1.encode("raw") == counter2.encode("raw"))
      (e.g. a.equals(b) <=> encode(a) == encode(b) -> use the interner)
    - Works for log distributions as well as non-log
      - This needs some re-thinking => how is it exposed, what does it affect beyond normalization
      - Should probably be in CounterMath rather than here (CounterMath.logDistribution(Counter) etc.)
- math/
  - CounterMath
    - Operates on raw backing for counters
    - Requires same templated type - for KL divergence etc.
    - Smoothing / Normalization
  - DifferentiableFunction
    - Built in caching

- Threading
  - Threading done at DoubleArrays level
  - All calls to DoubleArrays.* are async - placed in workqueue
  - Array-wide operations cause implicit synchronicity
  - Run until you need the result, then call DoubleArrays.sync() (this will return when all async processing done)
